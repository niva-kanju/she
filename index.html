          <h3>Scheme for Her Empowerment in Engineering education</h3>
          <p>
            The future of a country hinges on ensuring that the generations to come are adequately represented, qualified and able to carry the mantle of development forward. Advocating and recognizing women's contributions in technology and the way they collaborate to drive innovation and business growth has to be raised. A leading authority of professional tech savvy women has to be built.
            Thus, ‘Scheme for Her Empowerment in Engineering education (SHE)’ was introduced by the HR cell of GCEK to bridge this existing gap of women in tech. Through techno-socio initiatives, the scheme aims to equip women to face their future confidently in this rapidly changing landscape.
            This initiative works for the empowerment of women in the campus and strengthen them to be a part of all the main and back-end activities inside and outside the campus.
            It assures the active paricipants of women in carricular and extra carricular activities and enhance their abilities.The project aims to pave way for girls to come out breaking the boundaries that they created for themselves.
